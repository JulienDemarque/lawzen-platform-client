        <p>
          LawZen is platform opened for all to share law propositions. Think
          about tweeter but for seeing trends in political ideas. That would be
          a playground for direct democracy, a step before making a petition for
          asking a referendum.

        <h5 className="title is-5">Why LawZen?</h5>
        <p>
          We believe giving more control to citizen over the political sphere is
          not only just, but would likely help resolve some issues that the
          representative system couldn't. The idea of LawZen is to popularize
          the use of the Citizens' Initiative Referendum (RIC in french)
